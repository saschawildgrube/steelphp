Welcome to SteelPHP
TID_TEXT_HERO
SteelPHP is more than yet another php-based framework. It is a website development kit. It has all it takes to build complex, robust and secure web applications - from early prototypes to enterprise applications.<br/><br/>It supports a strict architecture approach.<br/><br/>It does not follow widespread conventions just for the sake of it.<br/><br/>The tallest buildings are made of steel.
TID_TITLE_CLAIM
6 important facts about SteelPHP
TID_TITLE_CLAIM-ARCHITECTURE
Strict architecture approach
TID_TEXT_CLAIM-ARCHITECTURE
In this website development kit each bit has its defined place. SteelPHP is not a set of loosely coupled components. SteelPHP comes with a strict architecture approach - on how websites and web services interact with each other, how databases are encapsulated, and how web applications are built and assembled internally.
TID_TITLE_CLAIM-CRUD
CRUD on steroids
TID_TEXT_CLAIM-CRUD
SteelPHP comes with a powerful CRUD feature. Database encapsulation, web service implementation, and management GUI is derived from configuration and code implementation (not just scaffolding) for ultimate development speed. E.g. adding a new attribute to an existing entity requires only 3 little changes. This is unrivaled.
TID_TITLE_CLAIM-TDD
Extreme Test Driven Development
TID_TEXT_CLAIM-TDD
In SteelPHP automated tests are not just part of a deployment process but a built-in feature of the web application you are building. Tests are part of the actual source code and deployed and continuously executed in production.
TID_TITLE_CLAIM-NOTYAPF
It’s not YAPF
TID_TEXT_CLAIM-NOTYAPF
SteelPHP is not just yet another php framework. This website development kit does not blindly follow conventions (like PSR-2) just for the sake of it. Its templating and separation of concerns approach is way beyond MVC. Its done right - not just like all others do it.
TID_TITLE_CLAIM-TEAM
Cool for large teams
TID_TEXT_CLAIM-TEAM
SteelPHP comes with a separation of concerns approach and code organization scheme that makes it suitable for larger projects teams. Different features and components alongside the vertical stack can be developed independently and simultaneously.
TID_TITLE_CLAIM-SECURITY
Security built-in
TID_TEXT_CLAIM-SECURITY
Needless to say but of course SteelPHP comes with various built-in security features. There is protection from malicious user content, means against SQL injection, cross site scripting, CSRF, session hijacking, tests that detect an insecure environment setup and more.

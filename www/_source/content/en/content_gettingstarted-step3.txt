=Getting Started - Step 3=
Now it is time to install the boilerplate web application.


Do the following:
# Unpack the zip archive you just downloaded
# Copy the files to your environment. The "www" folder is supposed to be the document root
# Follow the instructions in the readme.txt file

Please note that the "www" folder is the web server document root folder. If you do not want the "_source" folder to be a sub folder of the document root, you can put it to another place. In that case you have to adjust the path in the env.inc file.


Please also note that the {WDK} scaffolder assumes that you can use .htaccess files. If this is not the case you may have to move some of the configuration settings to another web server configuration file.


'''Good luck! Have fun!'''

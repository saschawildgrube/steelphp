=Getting Started - Step 2=

Set up a LA(M)P stack environment that has:
# A linux operating system
# An apache web server (or a web server with comparable features, but this would require you to make your hands dirty first)
# php
# Optional: A mySQL database - only if you chose the '''dynamic''' option

{WDK} will tell you later if certain plugins or specific system configuration is missing.


Go to step 3 to install your first web application!

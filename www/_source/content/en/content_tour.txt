==More than a framework==
{WDK} is more than a framework. It is a web application development kit.
{IMAGE id="wdkdocs-architecture"}
{WDK} supports building websites and web services.
It is not just a collection of loosly coupled classes and libraries - but an integrated set of components that help you to build complex applications in large teams.


==Getting started easily==
Use the scaffolder to create new boilerplate applications.





Build your own scaffolds to automate repetitive tasks when creating new features in your application system.

==Testing as a feature==
{WDK} has a unique yet unrivaled approach to testing.


Test scripts are part of the application source code and are deployed into all environments. The task schedules then runs all test scripts round-robin continuously in all target environments.


{WDK} comes with 300+ test scripts that check:
* REST-API interfaces
* HTML output
* Individual functions and classes
* Source code quality and files
* Environment configuration
==Information Architecture==
Build navigation trees easily.
